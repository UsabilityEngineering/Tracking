## Phase 2: Interaction Design

Here are some early drafts of our wireframes as exported from Adobe XD at 30% normal size.  They are organized roughly by purpose alongisde our thought processes while creating and refinining them.

### Base Menus

Warren: We had some false starts using several early artboards where clicking disabled buttons led to frustration.  After that, we made sure to indicate which portions of the screen visible behind the active dialog box or menu were currently inactive by 'greying' them out.  

### Info & Settings

Warren: Not shown is the duplicate About page that links back to the local menu rather than the main one.

### Data Management: Input

### Data Management: Output

Warren: We were surprised that our survey, which as noted was filled out with 'mock' data by our fellow students, showed the popularity of Instagram outshining that of Facebook.  We made sure to provide labeled export buttons for convenient posting to those two and several other notable social networks.
