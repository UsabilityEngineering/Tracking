# Tracking, Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection

## Methods

We set up a 15 question online survey in hopes of having an easy way to access our target group of generally online people.  Unfortunately, resolutions involving the Chico State Campus shutting down in-person classes for the semester meant that we instead gathered 18 people's worth of mock data from our classmates.

## Findings

### Online Survey:
#### Question 1: 
##### Do you have a smartphone or data-enabled tablet?
  This was just a yes/no question. Our results were that everyone who took the survey answered yes. This was basically in
  line with what we were thinking since they are so common now.
    
#### Question 2:
##### What communications technology do you use most?
  This question had 3 choices, laptop, desktop, and smartphone/data-enabled tablet. From our results, 66.7% of participants
  mainly use their smartphone/data-enabled tablet the most. And the rest is made up of 16.7% mainly laptop users and 16.7%
  mainly desktop users. We were expecting more smartphone users than we actually got.
  
#### Question 3:
##### How much time(daily) do you spend using that technology?
  This was a multiple choice question with 4 answers. The most frequent answer(72.2%)to this was 4-8 hours. This makes 
  sense since from our 2 previous questions we know that all participants have a smartphone and that is also the most used
  communications technology. Also, since wherever we go they go we have the most access to them.
    
#### Question 4:
##### Do you have an internet connection?
  This was a yes or no question. Although most of the answers were yes, we were expecting everyone to have an internet
  connection, since at this point it has almost become a utility or need rather than a luxury.
    
#### Question 5:
##### Landline and/or smartphone with data plan?
  This was a choose all that apply question. All participants chose smartphone with data plan. And out of those 22.2% also
  chose landline.
  
#### Question 6: 
##### Do you use social media?
  This was another yes or no question. 94.4% of participants answered yes. This was basically in line with what we thought,
  since their are so many different kinds of social media(Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc).
    
#### Question 7:
##### How many animals/pets do you have?
  This was a multiple choice question where we found that the majority of people(64.7%) have either 0 or 1 pets. 5.9% have 
  2 pets, 11.8% have 3 pets, and, what was really surprising was that, 17.6% have more than 5 pets.
    
#### Question 8: 
##### Have you used a GPS tracker before?
  Another yes or no question, where the results were 61.1% yes and 38.9% no. We had expected less people to have used a
  tracker before.
  
#### Question 9: 
##### How much money are you willing to spend on your pet(s)(per month)?
  This was a multiple choice question. The results were about what we had expected where, 12.5% of participants were willing
  to spend less than $25, 31.3% were willing to spend $25-$50, 37.5% were willing to spend $50-$100, and 18.8% were willing
  to spend over $100.
    
#### Question 10: 
##### Do you have concerns over privacy when you post Google Maps data?
  66.7% of participants answered yes and the rest answered no. We were expecting there to be more people answering yes.
  
#### Question 11: 
##### How much money are you willing to spend on tech assisting your jogging/walking exercise?
  The majority of participants(80%) answered less than $25, and the rest answered $25-$50. The other options $50-$100 and
  over $100 were not chosen at all.
   
#### Question 12: 
##### Do you jog or walk a regular route?
  66.7% of participants answered no to this question which makes sense when considering on our last question most people
  answered less than $25.
    
#### Question 13: 
##### Indoor Only / Mixed / Outdoor Only / Indoor Only With Frequent Escapes?
  This question was a follow up to how many pets the participants have. 66.7% of people answered with their pets being
  mixed between inside and outside. 26.7% were indoor only and 6.7% were outdoor only. The last option was indoor bit with 
  frequent escapes and this option was not chosen at all.
    
#### Question 14: 
##### What Social Media Platforms do you use?
  This was a choose all that apply with an optional other to write in an answer. The most chosen one was Instagram where
  81.3% of participants chose it. Next were Snapchat and Twitter which were tied at 75%, then Facebook with 68.8% of users
  answering that they use it. Lastly the written in answers include Tik-Tok, Discord, Myspace, Skype, and Steam all were
  tied at 6.3%.
    
#### Question 15: 
##### What marketplace app do you use?
  This question let us know what OS the participants used. There were 2 choices and the majority(77.8%) chose the Apple App
  Store and the rest chose the Google Play Store.

## Conclusions
The most reasonable platform to build for would be a smartphone since all of the participants have one and also since it was the most used form of communications technology. Within that since most people use the Apple App Store we can confidently say we should program with iOS in mind. Also we can see that the most used social media is instagram so if someone wants to share a map from the app we should export it as an image. Since from our findings we can see that most people would not want to spend more than $25 a month we need to make the app/tracker inexpensive. 

## Caveats
Since we only used an online survey this made it hard to get in depth because most of the questions were multiple choice ones and also since it was online it's only available to those who have an internet connection, but since this would be part of our target demographic this is fine. Also due to COVID-19 we were only able to get mock data from other students rather than a wider demographic.

Surveys are notably a hands off approach that we're mainly using right now to assemble background data.  As the prototype progresses, we would ideally like to do task analysis to keep us on track and observe actual people figuring out the evolving interface through a series of contextual inquiries.

## Personas

Provide each of your user personas, which represent (potential) users of your software; explain how you derived these personas from your user inquiry

## Scenarios

Identify the primary scenarios for your software and for each, include a description that explains who (of your personas) and what they want to do
