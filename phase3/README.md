# Phase 3: Usability Evaluation

## Interview Style Decisions

Having a live interview is appropriate for this phase of the project.  As we are dealing with a prototype, we are unable to do particular forms of more in depth research at this period, such as naturalistic observations of an alpha demo in the wild.  We are doing formative assessments of the user by observing their unconcious reactions in real-time to the tasks prompted by the interviewer, helped along by the interviewer prefacing the instructions with a prompt to speak their thoughts aloud.  Following this phase, we conduct a summative assement asking them to provide their thoughts and feelings on their experience and overall design of the app.

### Informed Consent
  As is important to have our participants informed of their privacy and data usage rights, we lead off all testing protocols with a prepared summary to gain their consent.
  
### Introduction
   In this phase we prep our users with prompts to help maximize the data we can collect from them, such as asking them to speak their thoughts aloud.  We also reassure them that this survey is to test our app design, not them in particular, and give our estimation that the testing and answer phase will only take an estimated fifteen to twenty minutes.  We pause here to see if the user has any questions before we proceed.
   
### Background

* What was the last GPS app you used and why did you use it?
 - We hope to get an estimate of the user's tech savviness as well as potentially useful programs for us to observe.
 
 * (Follow up to a positive response) What was something you desired from the app but it failed to deliver on?
  - This will help us both understand nuances of what is on the market as well as offering insights into the user's hopes and expectations for such.
  
### First Task
  * Step by step instructions on opening "How to Use" as well as saving and exporting a new creation altered by some of the Data FX features to social media.
   - This is our chance to observe how the program works in action as well as any difficulties the user has in navigating everything.  It also helps provide the user with an overview of what the program can accomplish.
   
* Asking them to rate their experience accomplishing this task on a 1 (Very Difficult) to 5 (Very Easy) scale.
  - This both acts as a way to refine the user experience and a positive feedback loop on future iterations of the interview protocol.
  
### Second Task
* Step by step instructions on how to load their saved creation and apply a GPS overlay of some mock 'imported' data reflecting the path of a pet's GPS tracker using RealTrail, followed by them saving their progress.
  - This is an easy way to become familiar with how the system delivers on the promise of handling GPS data.

* Asking them to rate their experience accomplishing this task on a 1 (Very Difficult) to 5 (Very Easy) scale.
  - We believe this question to be an effective way to judge responses.

### Wrap Up
This section is a series of hopefully easy questions to gauge their level of satisfaction and interest in the project.  The protocols  here include a prompt for the interviewer to follow up on any interesting points raised by the answer to each question.

* Overall, what did you like the most about it?
* What did you dislike the most about it?
* Are there any additional features you'd like to request?
* Weâ€™d like to now ask about your feedback on the navigation sidebar that you used throughout the app and get your thoughts on it.
 - Suggested questions involve how intuitive it was to navigate the program.
* Any other thoughts or comments?

### Conclusion
We take a moment to thank them very much for their feedback and reassure them that their answers have been heard and should help us improve this and future projects.  We leave them with our wishes that they'll have a wonderful day.
