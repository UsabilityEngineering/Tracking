## Interview Methods

### Informed Consent
  As is important to have our participants informed of their privacy and data usage rights, we lead off all testing protocols with a prepared summary to gain their consent.
  
### Introduction
   In this phase we prep our users with prompts to help maximize the data we can collect from them, such as asking them to speak their thoughts aloud.  We also reassure them that this survey is to test our app design, not them in particular, and give our estimation that the testing and answer phase will only take an estimated fifteen to twenty minutes.  We pause here to see if the user has any questions before we proceed.
   
### Background

* What was the last GPS app you used and why did you use it?
 - We hope to get an estimate of the user's tech savviness as well as potentially useful programs for us to observe.
 
 * (If answered 1.) What was something you desired from the app but it failed to deliver on?
  - This will help us both understand nuances of what is on the market as well as offering insights into the user's hopes and expectations for such.
