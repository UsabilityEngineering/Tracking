# Team Tracking: ArtsyTrail App

Introduction - Social media is a great way to share information and keep track of accomplishments.  Do you want to draw your biking route with your finger and have it shaded where it goes uphill and down?  Do you want the GPS data of where your cat goes at night presented in the dashed lines and bold x's of a classic comic?  For your privacy, it's best to obscure your exact location, so why not do it with style?  ArtsyTrail takes the fundamental work done by Google Maps and adds layers of detail and abstraction.

## Team Members

* **Henry Graves** - Summary of contributions
* **Shan Khinda** - Contributed to creating the survey, did the findings and conclusion in the report.
* **Warren Rose II** - Original Concept, Some Document Construction

## Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection

* Executive Summary of methods, data gathered, and most important outcomes
*  a concise summary of your work with bullet-point notes that provide general overview of the work completed. Focus on the “big picture” of the phase.
This phase of the project was mainly honing our design skills and evolving the early concepts into something with a wider user base.  The survey we wrote, although it was filled out with mock data by eighteen of our fellow students, should help provide a roadmap as we move forward.

##### Design Skill Workshops
* Comparative Methods of Data Gathering
     - Groundwork For Our Survey
* Usability Observation and Task Analysis
     - Methods to look into as our prototype progresses
* Digital Wireframes and How to Push the Boundaries of Design
     - Brainstorming Interfaces with each member of our team submitting:
       - A serious design sketch
       - A 'surreal' one

##### Paper Prototype
* Concept evolved from modifying GPS data from pet owners and park rangers to a more accessible program.
     - Our target audience now also includes:
       - Bikers and Joggers
       - Art Enthusiasts who want to redecorate their neighborhood
... In Progress...
