# Team Tracking: ArtsyTrail App

**Introduction** - Social media is a great way to share information and keep track of accomplishments.  Do you want to draw your biking route with your finger and have it shaded where it goes uphill and down?  Do you want the GPS data of where your cat goes at night presented in the dashed lines and bold x's of a classic comic?  For your privacy, it's best to obscure your exact location, so why not do it with style?  ArtsyTrail takes the fundamental work done by Google Maps and adds layers of detail and abstraction.

## Team Members

* **Henry Graves** - Survey data analysis, Persona design, Scenario development 
* **Shan Khinda** - Contributed to creating the survey, did the findings and conclusion in the report.
* **Warren Rose II** - Original concept, List of workflow and feature goals, Some document construction

## Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection

**Executive Summary** - This phase of the project was mainly honing our design skills and evolving the early concepts into something with a wider user base.  The survey we wrote, although it was filled out with mock data by eighteen of our fellow students, should help provide a roadmap as we move forward.

##### Design Skill Workshops
* Comparative Methods of Data Gathering
     - Groundwork For Our Survey
* Usability Observation and Task Analysis
     - Methods to look into as our prototype progresses
* Digital Wireframes and How to Push the Boundaries of Design
     - Brainstorming Interfaces with each member of our team submitting:
       - A serious design sketch
       - A 'surreal' one

##### Paper Prototype
* Concept evolved from modifying GPS data from pet owners and park rangers to a more accessible drawing program.
     - Our target audience now also includes:
       - Bikers and Joggers who want to estimate the distance of their route
       - Artists who want to redecorate their neighborhood
       - Social Media Enthusiasts traveling the country
* Groundwork for Task Analysis gave us a step by step summary of the features we expect in the app
     - RealSpace and RealTrail Layers
       - Accurate Maps and Raw GPS/Hand-drawn Data
     - TwistedSpace and TwistedTrail Layers
       - Scale and Smooth and add Cut-out Zoom Windows
     - ArtsySpace and ArtsyTrail Layers
       - Decorate the world with shading and stickers
     - Export Layer
       - Share your creations to printers and social media
     
##### Online Survey
* Accessible Google Docs Quiz with 15 Questions answered by 18 Mock Personas
     - Up Front User Consent Agreement Form Detailing Unlikely But Potential Risks
     - Our Savvy Personas generally spent between 4-8 hrs/day using online communications tech
     - Social Media was near universal and 3/5ths also have used GPS tech.
       - High overlap of media platforms
       - 2/3rds had privacy concerns when posting Google Maps Data
     - 3/4 users chose the Apple App Store over Google Play
       - We need to focus first on the iOS Market
       - Although both are used by the majority, Instagram easily beats Facebook in popularity
     - Only a third walk or jog a regular route
     - Most people had indoor/outdoor pets
       - They were far more willing to spend money on their pets than on their walking exercise
